# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tentaqles plugin. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-16 — "Portable Runtime"

Full cross-platform compatibility for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Fixes plugin breakage on machines where `python` doesn't exist (macOS), resolves to a broken venv shim, or points to a Windows Store stub.

### Added

- **`scripts/tq_env.sh`** — POSIX-compatible runtime bootstrap. Resolves `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (env var → `$BASH_SOURCE` → filesystem search), finds a working Python interpreter (`py -3` → `python3` → `python`, validated via `sys.executable`), exports `PYTHONPATH`, and runs `bootstrap.py` if core deps are missing. Works in bash, zsh, and dash.
- **`scripts/tq_run.sh`** — thin wrapper: sources `tq_env.sh`, then exec's the target script with the resolved interpreter. Used by all hooks and skills.
- **`.gitattributes`** — forces LF line endings on `*.sh`, `*.py`, `*.json`, `*.md` to prevent CRLF "bad interpreter" errors when cloning from Windows to Unix.
- **Touch event acknowledgment.** The `touch` handler in `memory-bridge.py` now prints `{"touch_id": "..."}` on success, matching `decision` and `pending` handler behavior.

### Fixed

- **macOS compatibility.** Hooks now use `bash tq_run.sh` instead of bare `python` (which doesn't exist on macOS Catalina+). The interpreter probe finds `python3` automatically.
- **POSIX shell compatibility.** Removed `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` array subscript (breaks dash/sh on Ubuntu/Debian). Uses `$BASH_SOURCE` without subscript, guarded by `$BASH_VERSION` check, with glob fallback for non-bash shells.
- **Windows Store Python.** `bootstrap.py` detects the `WindowsApps/` stub executable and resolves the real interpreter via the `py` launcher before calling `pip install --target`.
- **Plugin cache discovery.** Skill preludes now check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (not `plugin.json` at root) and use a marketplace-agnostic glob (`*/tentaqles/*/` instead of `tentaqles/tentaqles/*/`).
- **`session_end` without prior `session_start`.** `MemoryStore.end_session()` auto-creates a session if none is active (lazy upsert).
- **Naive/aware datetime mixing.** `end_session` now treats legacy naive timestamps as UTC, preventing `TypeError` on databases migrated from pre-v0.3 versions.
- **XDG-compliant data paths.** Fallback plugin data dir uses `~/Library/Application Support/tentaqles` on macOS and `~/.local/share/tentaqles` on Linux (was `~/.tentaqles` everywhere).
- **Executable permissions.** `.sh` files are committed with `+x` bit so they work on macOS/Linux without manual `chmod`.
- All 17 skills updated: `"$TENTAQLES_PY"` instead of bare `python`, `PYTHONPATH` instead of `sys.path.insert` hacks.

### Breaking

None. All changes are backward compatible.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-13 — "Memory Matures"

Six architectural features that deepen how the plugin remembers, reasons about, and shares knowledge across workspaces.

### Added

- **4-tier memory consolidation with decay.** Brain-inspired tiers: Working → Episodic → Semantic → Procedural. Sessions auto-promote to Episodic on close; important facts climb to Semantic and Procedural over time. Ebbinghaus decay evicts stale entries automatically. New tables `semantic_memories` and `procedural_memories` in `memory.db`; new column `sessions.memory_tier`. Skill: `/tentaqles:compact-memory`. Cron: `scripts/compaction-cron.py`.
- **Contradiction detection and supersession.** When a new decision is recorded, it is embedded and compared cosine-similarity against active decisions. If similarity > 0.82 and the text disagrees, the old decision is auto-superseded — the chain is preserved, not deleted. New column `decisions.contradiction_score`. Skill: `/tentaqles:decision-history`. Programmatic: `MemoryStore.get_decision_lineage()`.
- **Time-travel snapshots.** Append-only JSON snapshots at `{workspace}/.claude/snapshots/{utc_iso}.json` capture the manifest, memory stats, and git identity at a point in time. Auto-fires on identity auto-switch and any Write to `.tentaqles.yaml` via the `snapshot-guard.py` PreToolUse hook. Keeps last 30; older pruned. Skill: `/tentaqles:rollback`.
- **Workspace profiles (learned, not declared).** Auto-generated profile from `memory.db` — hot files, session frequency, top concepts — written to `{workspace}/.claude/profile.json` and injected into the SessionStart preamble. Regenerates automatically when >7 days old. Skill: `/tentaqles:profile-refresh`.
- **Cross-workspace pattern detection.** Weekly background job reads decisions from all registered workspace memory.dbs (read-only), embeds them, clusters them, and surfaces patterns that span two or more workspaces. Output at `{data_dir}/metagraph/patterns.json`, surfaced in `MetaMemory.get_cross_workspace_context()`. Skill: `/tentaqles:cross-patterns`. Cron: `scripts/pattern-cron.py`.
- **Inter-workspace signals (pub/sub).** A `signals` table in the global `meta.db` lets Workspace A emit a message to Workspace B; B reads it on next session start. 48-hour TTL, acknowledge-once. Opt-in per workspace via `signals:` manifest block. Skill: `/tentaqles:emit-signal`.

### Schema

All additions backward compatible (`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with `OperationalError` catch). Existing v0.2 databases migrate on first open.

- `sessions.memory_tier` column (values: `working`, `episodic`)
- `decisions.contradiction_score` column
- New `semantic_memories` table
- New `procedural_memories` table
- New `signals` table in global `meta.db`

### Manifest

New optional section:

```yaml
signals:
  enabled: true
  subscribe_to: [dirtybird, acme-corp]
```

Missing section = feature disabled. Fully backward compatible.

### Build

- Tests: 60 → 238 (178 new)
- Pip dependencies added: 0
- New modules: 10
- New scripts: 4
- New skills: 6

## [0.2.0] — "Foundation"

The first public release after the rebrand. Six Tier 1 quick wins on top of the workspace identity / temporal memory / knowledge graph foundation.

### Added

- **PreCompact hook re-injection.** Critical state (manifest summary, decisions, hot nodes) is re-injected into the conversation before Claude Code auto-compacts, so important context survives compaction.
- **Privacy filter.** Every observation is scanned for secrets (API keys, JWTs, OAuth tokens, connection strings, private keys, cross-client emails) before touching disk. Integrated into store, session-end, knowledge-capture, and memory-bridge.
- **File history skill.** `/tentaqles:file-history` shows everything the plugin has recorded about a specific file — touches, decisions, pending items, across sessions.
- **Open thread auto-detection.** End-of-session parser detects unresolved threads from the transcript and records them as pending items automatically.
- **Self-improving skills.** User corrections are recorded to the skill's own definition at `{client_root}/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. Per-client isolation — one client's corrections never affect another.
- **Real-time dashboard.** Runs at `http://localhost:8765` with a live grid of workspaces, hot nodes, and pending items. Pure stdlib, self-contained HTML, works offline.

Plus the v0.1 foundation: workspace auto-detection via `.tentaqles.yaml`, auto-switching git/gh/az/aws identity, preflight checks, per-client SQLite temporal memory, pluggable knowledge graph engine (graphify or native), and cross-workspace semantic search via the meta-graph.
